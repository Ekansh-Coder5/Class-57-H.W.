<p>Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software. Without it, we'd have none of the most popular technology we've come to rely on such as Facebook, our smartphones, the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code..</p>
